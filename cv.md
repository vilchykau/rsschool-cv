### I'm a student of BSU, FAMCS. Now, I am on 2nd year and I started thinking about finding a job. But there is a problem. I didn't have experience working on serious projects, working in a team. Somebody can say, you are studying in the university, doing labs. But I recognize that it's not enough for starting a career. But anywhere, university and self-studying gave me some skills.

### **Skills I have**: knowledge about algorithms, basic concepts OOP, patterns, C\C++, basic Java Core, git. I've learned a little about ML(I added info to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2-552550182/"> linkedin</a>)
